a good visualization has everything the user needs to make a conslusion as quick as possible as they look at the graphics. In an example I found, a history of the national football league is shown with an option to choose a team and it shows the teams elo, which is a calculated measument of how good the team is. It also had a graphic representing the championships of the teams with a yellow dot. This could be used to relate teams to one another over certain years because of the goodness of the team and how many championships they had won.

<h1> bad visualization</h1>
<p>
an example I found about the batting averages of cricket players in a certain city. It is relating the city to the batting averages with a picture of a famous building in the city and giving a number above of the batting average. This visualiztion does not provide the viewer with anything to visually relate the two dimensions other than a number. This does not lead to any sort of conclusion, so it might as well be a table.
